	<p>
	Log messages are sent to server the moment this page is opened.
	</p>
	<p>
	The code generating the log messages is in scripts/jsnlogdemo.js.
	</p>
	<p>
	JSNLog sets the <i>window.onerror</i> handler when it loads, so uncaught JavaScript exceptions are sent to your server side log.
	However, it will only do that if <i>window.onerror</i> has not already been set 
	(<a href="http://jsnlog.com/Documentation/HowTo/ExceptionLogging">details</a>). That way, if you are setting your own onerror handler, it won't override that.

<h2>Demo on using the serialize option to log objects with cyclic references</h2>

<p>
	This project shows how to log objects that have cyclic references. That is, they somehow refer to themselves.
</p>

<p>
	It does this by:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Importing file 
		<a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/cycle.js" target="_blank">cycle.js</a>, 
		which has a method <i>decycle</i> that replaces cyclic references with a meaningful string.
	</li>
	<li>
		Using the 
		<a href="http://jsnlog.com/Documentation/HowTo/CyclicObjects" target="_blank">serialize</a>
		option to set a custom method to process objects into strings. That custom method uses the <i>decycle</i> method to deal with cyclic references.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Do a View Source on this page to see this in action. The code that sets the <i>serialize</i> option is in file <i>jsnlogdemo.js</i>.
</p>

<script>
	// Log simple cyclic object
	var a = { x: 1 };
	a.c = a;
	JL().error(a);

    // Log cyclic object where 2 objects make up the cycle
	var a2 = { x: 1 };
	var b2 = { y: 2 };
	b2.d = { e: a2 };
	a2.c = { b: b2 };
	JL().error(a2);
</script>
